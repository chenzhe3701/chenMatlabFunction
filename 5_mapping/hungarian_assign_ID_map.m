% chenzhe, 2018-05-18, fix bug to check both worker and job having match. 
% chenzhe, 2018-06-14, modify to make it faster, using accumarray
% chenzhe, 2018-06-27, add output, ID_new_unbalance can try to assign as
% many as possible. (ID_new is one-to-one match).
% So, if clean EBSD, ID_new_unbalance can be used to assign euler angle.
% And ID_new can be used to assign ID.
% 
% chenzhe, 2018-07-28, add additional input 'max_previous_ID'.
% If do not give previous maximum ID, assume it is the max of input ID map.
% The reason is, DIC area might be smaller than EBSD area, so ID_target may
% actually have less grains than actually scanned during EBSD.
